This guide helps you resolve common issues when using the Replit Duplicate Detector Extension.

## üö® Common Issues

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading Times
**Symptoms**: Application takes a long time to load, requests timeout
**Solutions**:
- **Refresh the page** and try again
- **Clear browser cache** and reload
- **Check internet connection** stability
- **Try a different browser** or incognito mode
- **Close other browser tabs** to free up memory

#### Analysis Timeouts
**Symptoms**: Project analysis fails or stops unexpectedly
**Solutions**:
- **Analyze smaller batches** of projects at a time
- **Check project sizes** - very large projects may timeout
- **Wait and retry** - temporary server overload may resolve
- **Contact support** if issue persists

### Authentication Problems

#### Cannot Sign In
**Symptoms**: OAuth flow fails, stuck on login page
**Solutions**:
- **Ensure you're signed into Replit** in the same browser
- **Disable popup blockers** that may block OAuth window
- **Try incognito/private browsing** mode
- **Clear cookies and cache** for both sites
- **Check browser console** for error messages

#### Session Expires Frequently
**Symptoms**: Keep getting logged out, need to re-authenticate
**Solutions**:
- **Check browser settings** for cookie restrictions
- **Ensure stable internet connection**
- **Contact support** if problem persists across sessions

### Project Detection Issues

#### Missing Projects
**Symptoms**: Some of your Replit projects don't appear
**Solutions**:
- **Verify project visibility** - private projects may not be accessible
- **Check project activity** - inactive projects may not sync
- **Refresh project list** using the refresh button
- **Ensure projects contain supported file types**

#### Empty Analysis Results
**Symptoms**: Analysis completes but shows no duplicates
**Solutions**:
- **Check similarity threshold** settings
- **Verify file types** are supported (JS, TS, Python, etc.)
- **Review project contents** - very small projects may have no duplicates
- **Try different pattern detection settings**

### Database and Storage Issues

#### Analysis History Missing
**Symptoms**: Previous analysis results are gone
**Solutions**:
- **Check if logged into same account**
- **Database may have been reset** during updates
- **Re-run analysis** to regenerate results
- **Contact support** if data loss is unexpected

### Browser Compatibility

#### UI Elements Not Working
**Symptoms**: Buttons don't respond, layout appears broken
**Solutions**:
- **Update to latest browser version**
- **Enable JavaScript** in browser settings
- **Disable browser extensions** that may interfere
- **Try different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

#### Mobile Device Issues
**Symptoms**: Poor experience on mobile/tablet
**Solutions**:
- **Use landscape mode** for better layout
- **Zoom out** if content appears too large
- **Switch to desktop** for complex analysis tasks
- **Report mobile-specific issues** for future improvements

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### Console Debugging

#### Checking Browser Console
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for error messages** (red text)
4. **Copy error details** for support requests

#### Common Console Errors
- **Network errors**: Check internet connection
- **CORS errors**: Usually temporary, try refreshing
- **JavaScript errors**: May indicate browser compatibility issues

### Network Issues

#### Connection Problems
**Check these items**:
- Stable internet connection
- Firewall not blocking requests
- VPN not interfering with OAuth
- Corporate network restrictions

### Performance Monitoring

#### Identifying Slow Requests
The application monitors request performance and logs warnings for requests taking >2 seconds. If you see frequent slow request warnings:

1. **Check server status** at `/health` endpoint
2. **Monitor memory usage** in browser dev tools
3. **Reduce concurrent operations**
4. **Contact support** with timing details

# Getting Started with Replit Duplicate Detector Extension

This guide will walk you through setting up and using the Replit Duplicate Detector Extension for the first time.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Replit Account**: A valid Replit account with projects to analyze
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Required for the web interface to function
- **Internet Connection**: Stable connection for API communication

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### Step 1: Access the Extension

1. **Navigate** to the Replit Duplicate Detector Extension URL
2. **Bookmark** the page for easy future access
3. **Verify** that the page loads correctly

### Step 2: Authentication

1. **Click "Sign in with Replit"** on the landing page
2. **Authorize** the application when prompted by Replit
3. **Grant permissions** for the extension to access your projects
4. **Wait** for the redirect back to the extension dashboard

```
Note: The extension requires read access to your Replit projects
to perform duplicate analysis. We never modify or delete your code.
```

### Step 3: Initial Dashboard Overview

After successful authentication, you'll see:

- **Project Summary**: Total number of projects detected
- **Analysis Status**: Current scanning progress
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons to start analysis or refresh data
- **Navigation Menu**: Access to different sections

## üîç Your First Analysis

### Step 1: Project Discovery

The extension automatically discovers your Replit projects:

1. **Review** the projects list in the sidebar
2. **Verify** that all your expected projects appear
3. **Note** any projects that might be missing (private repos may not be visible)

### Step 2: Running Analysis

1. **Click "Analyze Projects"** in the main dashboard
2. **Monitor** the progress bar as analysis proceeds
3. **Wait** for completion (time varies based on project count and size)

#### What Happens During Analysis

- **Project Scanning**: Each project is scanned for code files
- **Pattern Detection**: Code is analyzed for functions, classes, and patterns
- **Similarity Calculation**: Patterns are compared across projects
- **Result Storage**: Findings are saved for quick future access

### Step 3: Reviewing Results

Once analysis completes:

1. **Check** the statistics panel for overview numbers
2. **Browse** detected duplicate groups in the results panel
3. **Click** on any duplicate group to see detailed comparison
4. **Use** filters to focus on specific types of duplicates

## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard shows key metrics:

- **Total Projects**: Number of projects analyzed
- **Duplicates Found**: Count of duplicate code groups detected
- **Similar Patterns**: Count of similar (but not identical) patterns
- **Languages**: Breakdown by programming language

### Duplicate Types

The extension detects several types of duplicates:

#### Exact Duplicates
- **Definition**: Identical code with same functionality
- **Examples**: Copy-pasted functions, repeated utility code
- **Action**: Consider creating shared utilities or libraries

#### Similar Patterns
- **Definition**: Code with similar structure but different details
- **Examples**: Similar algorithms with different variable names
- **Action**: Look for opportunities to generalize and reuse

#### Structural Duplicates
- **Definition**: Similar file structures or project organization
- **Examples**: Repeated project templates or boilerplate
- **Action**: Create project templates or starter kits

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Code Cleanup
1. **Identify** exact duplicates across projects
2. **Extract** common code into shared utilities
3. **Update** projects to use shared components
4. **Remove** redundant code

### Learning and Improvement
1. **Review** patterns in your coding style
2. **Identify** commonly used algorithms or patterns
3. **Create** personal code libraries for reuse
4. **Improve** code organization and structure

### Project Organization
1. **Find** similar project structures
2. **Standardize** project templates
3. **Identify** opportunities for consolidation
4. **Improve** overall project management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Your Experience

### Analysis Settings

You can customize analysis behavior:

- **Similarity Threshold**: Adjust how similar code needs to be to count as a duplicate
- **File Types**: Choose which file types to include in analysis
- **Project Filters**: Include or exclude specific projects
- **Pattern Types**: Focus on specific types of code patterns

### Interface Preferences

Customize the interface to your liking:

- **Theme**: Choose between light and dark themes
- **Layout**: Adjust panel sizes and arrangements
- **Notifications**: Configure when to receive alerts
- **Auto-refresh**: Set automatic refresh intervals

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: Can't sign in or getting authentication errors
**Solutions**:
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser or incognito mode
- Ensure you're signed into Replit in the same browser
- Check that popup blockers aren't preventing OAuth

### Missing Projects

**Issue**: Some projects don't appear in the list
**Solutions**:
- Verify projects are public or accessible to the extension
- Check that projects contain supported file types
- Refresh the project list manually
- Ensure projects have been recently active

### Analysis Failures

**Issue**: Analysis stops or fails to complete
**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try analyzing smaller batches of projects
- Refresh the page and restart analysis
- Check browser console for error messages

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow loading or analysis times
**Solutions**:
- Close other browser tabs to free memory
- Analyze projects in smaller batches
- Check for large files that might slow processing
- Use a faster internet connection if possible

## üìà Best Practices

### Regular Analysis
- **Schedule**: Run analysis weekly or after major coding sessions
- **Monitor**: Watch for trends in duplicate creation
- **Act**: Address duplicates promptly to prevent accumulation
- **Review**: Regularly review and clean up your project organization

### Code Organization
- **Extract**: Move common code to shared utilities early
- **Template**: Create project templates for common patterns
- **Document**: Keep notes on intentional code reuse vs. accidental duplication
- **Standardize**: Develop consistent coding patterns across projects

### Collaborative Use
- **Share**: Share results with team members for group cleanup efforts
- **Discuss**: Use findings to discuss coding standards and practices
- **Plan**: Include duplicate cleanup in sprint planning
- **Learn**: Use patterns to identify training opportunities

## üÜò Getting Help

### Resources
- **Documentation**: Check this wiki for detailed guides
- **FAQ**: Review frequently asked questions

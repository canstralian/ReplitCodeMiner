# Performance Notes

This document outlines current performance characteristics and optimization efforts for the Replit Duplicate Detector Extension.

## Current Performance Status

### Known Issues
- **Slow initial load times**: First page load can take 2-5 seconds
- **Asset loading delays**: Component files may load slowly on mobile
- **Analysis timeouts**: Large projects may timeout during analysis

### Monitoring
The application includes built-in performance monitoring:
- **Request timing**: Logs requests taking >2 seconds
- **Memory monitoring**: Tracks heap usage and warns at >90%
- **Health checks**: Available at `/health` and `/ready` endpoints

### Console Warnings
You may see these warnings in development:
```
Slow request detected: GET / took 2556ms
Slow request detected: GET /@react-refresh took 2183ms
```
These are logged for monitoring purposes and help identify performance bottlenecks.

## Optimization Efforts

### Completed Optimizations
- âœ… Multi-level caching system implemented
- âœ… Database query optimization
- âœ… Lazy loading for components
- âœ… Code splitting with Vite

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Asset bundling optimization
- ðŸ”„ Database indexing improvements
- ðŸ”„ Memory usage optimization
- ðŸ”„ Mobile performance enhancements

### Planned Optimizations
- ðŸ“‹ Service worker implementation
- ðŸ“‹ Progressive loading strategies
- ðŸ“‹ CDN integration for static assets
- ðŸ“‹ Background processing for analysis

## Performance Recommendations

### For Users
- **Use desktop browsers** for best performance
- **Close unnecessary tabs** to free memory
- **Analyze projects in smaller batches**
- **Clear browser cache** if experiencing slowness

### For Developers
- **Monitor console logs** for performance warnings
- **Profile memory usage** during development
- **Test on slower connections** to identify bottlenecks
- **Use the health endpoints** for system monitoring

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Page load time**: Target <2 seconds
- **Analysis time**: Target <30 seconds for typical projects
- **Memory usage**: Keep <500MB heap size
- **Error rate**: Maintain <1% error rate

### Monitoring Tools
- Built-in request timing middleware
- Health check endpoints
- Browser performance profiling
- Server-side memory monitoring

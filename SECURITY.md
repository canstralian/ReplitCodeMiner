## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Contact Methods

- **Email**: Send details to `security@your-domain.com`
- **GitHub**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" feature in the Security tab
- **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers privately

### 3. What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity

## 🛡 Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 with Replit
- JWT token-based sessions
- Role-based access control
- Session timeout management

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (Helmet.js)
- Environment variable protection
- Secrets management
- Regular dependency updates

### Code Security
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security testing
- Code review requirements

## 🔍 Security Scanning

### Automated Checks
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- ESLint security rules
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection

### Manual Reviews
- Security-focused code reviews
- Periodic security assessments
- Penetration testing (when applicable)

## 📋 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use secure coding practices

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA when available
- Keep your Replit account secure
- Report suspicious activity
- Don't share sensitive information in code

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints are rate-limited
- Abuse detection mechanisms in place
- Temporary blocking for suspicious activity

### Data Handling
- No sensitive code content is permanently stored
- Analysis results are cached temporarily
- User data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### Third-Party Integrations
- Replit API integration follows their security guidelines
- OpenAI API calls are made server-side only
- No client-side API key exposure

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security settings
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-jwt-secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
CORS_ORIGIN=your-frontend-domain

# Optional security enhancements
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600000
```

### Headers Configuration
The application automatically sets security headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection
